# Voice Conversion Project

## Overview
This project is dedicated to developing advanced voice conversion technology using deep learning techniques. Our aim is to transform diverse voice inputs into a single, consistent target voice while preserving the original speech's nuances.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Google Colab account
- Access to Google Drive

### Installation and Usage
1. **Google Colab/Drive Setup**: This project is implemented and executed using Google Colab and Google Drive. Ensure you have access to these services.

2. **Accessing the Notebooks**:
   - `main.ipynb` is the primary notebook for the project, featuring the successful implementation of our voice conversion model.
   - `failed_example.ipynb` provides insights into our initial approach, which was later revised due to its limitations.

3. **Data and Pre-trained Models**:
   - Links to download necessary data and our pre-trained models are included within `main.ipynb`. Follow the instructions in the notebook for setup.
   - You also have the option to download data directly from YouTube for training. Instructions for this process are provided in the notebook.

## Project Structure
- `main.ipynb`: The main Jupyter notebook with the implementation of the voice conversion model.
- `failed_example.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook documenting our initial, unsuccessful approach.

## Usage
### Recommended
