## Project Description

This project aims to create a sophisticated voice conversion system using deep learning, with a focus on transforming the voice characteristics from various speakers into the voice of a single, well-known individual. The project explores the nuances of voice identity, contributing to the field of digital audio processing.

## Problem Definition

The project addresses the challenges in voice conversion, aiming to transform varied voice inputs into a single, consistent target voice. It builds on existing works in the field and integrates advanced deep learning techniques to achieve more nuanced and authentic voice conversion.

## Dataset

The project utilizes a carefully curated dataset from YouTube, focusing on a specific individual known for their participation in noise-free environments. The dataset consists of clean, high-quality audio recordings, predominantly interviews, lectures, or presentations.

## Methodology

The methodology involves preprocessing voice data, developing a many-to-one voice conversion model, and utilizing cutting-edge deep learning techniques. The core development includes modeling key attributes such as pitch, timbre, and rhythm. Advanced models like VIDS, hn-NSF, and HiFi-GAN are employed for disentanglement, source-filter differentiation, and high-fidelity generation.
